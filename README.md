- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML (`<ul>`, `<li>`, ARIA roles) and keyboard-focusable dropdowns/switch.  
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first, `flex-col` on small screens, `flex-row` on larger screens.  
- **UI Library:** Built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) + TailwindCSS.  
- **Interactivity:** Dropdown menus, switch toggle, and state management with React hooks.
